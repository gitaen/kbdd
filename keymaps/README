New Busysbox also includes console-tools for dumping and loading keymaps.
But those tools can only store and load binary keymaps as stored in the
kernel. Thus the textual representation has to be compiled into binary form.

Pityly there is no tool for it. So I installed the keymap und dumped it
afterwards :( Bad technique but only way curently. If anyone knows of a
better method, please let me know.

Current keymaps in this directory:
bb-de.kmap	-	Busybox compatible 'de' (German) keymap
bb-en.kmap	-	Busybox compatible 'en' (English) keymap
ipaq-de.map	-	German console-tools (ASCII) keymap for iPaq
